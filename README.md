# Minecodes' Nothing Ringtones
## About
This organisation is for my ringtone animations on the Nothing Phone (1) and Phone (2).
You can contribute to the repositories with Audacity by using the [GLYPH Tools](https://github.com/SebiAI/custom-nothing-glyph-tools) by SebiAI.
The songs are not going to be included in the repository, only the lable files (importable into Audacity) and a link to the song or the custom cut versions of the song if allowed by the artist.

## Tools used
 - Audacity
 - [SebiAI/custom-nothing-glyph-tools](https://github.com/SebiAI/custom-nothing-glyph-tools)

## Disclaimer
Non of these songs are mine (except if I mention it). Please don't just download the songs (if here available) and listen to them,
but instead support the artist by listening to they're music on the official platforms.
For copyright problems please write me a email, so I can help resolving it.
