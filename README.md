# Minecodes' Nothing Ringtones
## About
This organization is for my ringtone animations on the Nothing Phone (1) and Phone (2).
You can contribute to the repositories with Audacity by using the [GLYPH Tools](https://github.com/SebiAI/custom-nothing-glyph-tools) by SebiAI.
The songs are not going to be included in the repository, only the label files (importable into Audacity) and a link to the song or the custom-cut versions of the song if allowed by the artist.

## Tools used
 - Audacity
 - [SebiAI/custom-nothing-glyph-tools](https://github.com/SebiAI/custom-nothing-glyph-tools)

## Disclaimer
None of these songs are mine (except if I mention it). Please don't just download the songs (if they are available) and listen to them,
but instead, support the artist by listening to their music on the official platforms.
For copyright problems please write me an email, so I can help resolve it.
